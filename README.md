# Translator: English to Portuguese


Building a translator from English to Portuguese using Deep Learning.


- [Encoder-Decoder Architecture with GloVe Embedding](https://github.com/diegodebrito/dl-translator/blob/master/portuguese-translator.ipynb): First model on this project. Encoder-Decoder architecture using LSTM layers and GloVe embedding for the Encoder.
- [Embedding Matrix Script](https://github.com/diegodebrito/dl-translator/blob/master/process_glove_encoding.py): simple script that generates the embedding matrix.
